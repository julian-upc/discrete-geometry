This is the preliminary version of the lecture notes for the second
part of \emph{Discrete and Algorithmic Geometry} (Universitat
Politècnica de Catalunya), held in the fall semester of 2011 by Vera
Sacristan and Julian Pfeifle.

\medskip
These notes are fruit of the collaborative effort of all participating
students, who have taken turns in assembling this text. The name of
each scribe figures in each corresponding section.

\medskip
The main literature for this course consists of
\cite{Conway-Sloane-3rd}, \cite{Conway-Strauss08}
and~\cite{Senechal95}. 

\medskip Suggestions for improvements will always be gladly received
by \texttt{julian.pfeifle@upc.edu}.
