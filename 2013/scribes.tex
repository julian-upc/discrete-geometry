\section{Alex Alvarez}
I have done a double degree in Informatics Engineering and Mathematics at the UPC and during these years I have participated in programming contests both individually and representing the UPC. I am mainly interested in Algorithms and Data Structures and I would like to start a PhD in those topics next year, but I also enjoy learning about Discrete Mathematics, in particular Combinatorics and Graph Theory.

\section{Your name}

achieve from this course.
