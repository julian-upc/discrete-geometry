\section{Anna Somoza}

I have recently finished a degree in Mathematics at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. During this degree I developed a great interest in Algebra fields. In particular, I took the optional subjects \emph{Algebraic Geometry}, \emph{Algebraic Topology} and \emph{Galois Theory} and I wrote my Final Degree Thesis on a topic of Number Theory.

Now I'm taking the Master in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering to develop my knowledge in these and other fields, and I my aim is to start a PhD in Number Theory next year. I enroled this subject because I have allways liked both computer science and geometry, and it seemed to be interesting. Therefore, I would be interested in the topic related to algebraic geometry.
