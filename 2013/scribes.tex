\section{Daniel Torres}

My name is Daniel Torres and I am graduate in mathematics in UPC. Along the degree I have developed much interest in fields of topology, algebra and geometry, and some loathing to study (not to programming) numerical methods and modelling. I decided study this master, and particularly this subject, for expand my knowledge about my interests.

More concretely, I am doing this course with the hope it shows me about geometry.
