Write code to output the directed graph of a polytope such that a
given face is the initial set.

input: 
  polytope P
  face F     

output: directed graph such that F is the initial set of the
orientation

the orientation of the graph is to be given by an objective function
that selects F

implementation:

  - given P and G, calculate a linear objective function that selects
    G

to do this, enumerate all facets F that contain G, 
and calculate their normal vectors n_F, 
and calculate a positive linear combination of all n_F,
for example, their sum.

    in a different function,
  - orient the graph of P with respect to this objective function.
