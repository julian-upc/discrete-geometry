Put your completed exercises into a .pdf into this directory.

Encrypt the .pdf with gpg or similar, 
and address the file to me using the public key ../../../../julian.gpg.pub .

Be sure to only commit and push the encrypted copy! You may want to change the filename to avoid leaking your name to the Internet.
