title="{Sphere packings, lattices and groups. With additional contributions by

    Parker, L. Queen and B. B. Venkov. 3rd ed.}",

abstract="{For a review of the 1st ed. see (1988; Zbl 0634.52002) and of the 2nd
    ed. see (1993; Zbl 0785.11036).\par The third edition of this well-known
    book shows the still growing interest in the subject matter of this book,
    which sometimes is called the bible of sphere packings. In fact the
    ``Conway-Sloane'' is indispensable for everybody working on this subject and
    related fields. \par Compared with the first and second edition, the third
    one has changed in two essential points (besides some small corrections and
    improvements to the main text): The bibliography and the preface. \par In
    particular the bibliography, which was already excellent in the first
    edition, has been enlarged and completed remarkably. It now consists of 106
    pages. The supplementary bibliography (1988-1998) alone has 38 pages or more
    than 800 items.\par Extremely useful is also the preface to the 3rd edition,
    which is a substantially expanded version of the preface to the 2nd edition.
    This 35-pages preface gives an excellent report on the essential
    developments during the last decade, i.e. since the appearance of the first
    edition. So the preface is an excellent survey itself. For the contents of
    the main part, which contains 30 chapters, we refer to the review of the
    first edition. Needless to say that they are updated and that they
    (different from the bible) contain also proofs.\par Anybody interested in
    sphere packings, codes, lattices in $n$-space, Leech latticee geometry of
    numbers, finite groups or quadratic forms should buy this book. Of course
    also any mathematical institute and any library should buy it. But this
    timely book is also addressed to engineers working on coding theory, to
    physicists and chemists and crystallographers. \par The price of this book
    is really moderate compared to the wealth and abundance of material and
    information. So it can also be recommended to students.}",
