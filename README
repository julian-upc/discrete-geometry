This is repository for the second part of Discrete and Algorithmic
Geometry (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya), held so far in the
fall semesters of 2011, 2013, 2014 by Julian Pfeifle.

The lecture notes from 2011 and 2013 are fruit of the collaborative
effort of all participating students, who have taken turns in
assembling this text. The name of each scribe figures in each
corresponding section.
