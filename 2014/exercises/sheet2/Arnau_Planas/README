To use this program you must be sure that you are following the next steps:

-You must create at least 3 files for the data: two containing 
the matrices representig the tetrahedron and the other one with 
your candidate to be a transformation between this two tetrahedrons.

-You must create another file called "input.txt" with the name of the 
previous files. For instance, you can write:

matrix_P1.txt matrix_P2.txt result_P1_P2.txt

-If you want to check more than one time (with different data) if a matrix
is the transformation between two tetrahedrons. You must create the appropiate
files and write the names at the "input.txt". For instance:

matrix_P1.txt matrix_P2.txt result_P1_P2.txt
matrix_P3.txt matrix_P4.txt result_P3_P4.txt


The program will answer your question with a note in the console. In addition
the program will create a file with all the matrices transforming the tetrahedrons.
The files attached may conform an appropiate example.

WARNING: Your inputs must be matrices 4x4 with the rows as the vertices
of the tetrahedrons, that have to be linearly independents. If your coordenates
are too much big (Graham number is not valid) the program is not going 
to work properly.
