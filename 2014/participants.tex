\section*{Quentin Pergeline}
(github login lafaillette) I am a french engineer with some knowledge in computer science and applied mathematics.
I am currently doing an Erasmus semester at the UPC FME, before trying to find an internship to get my diploma.

\section*{Clara Mateo}
I am from Santa Perp\`etua de la Mogoda but I live in Barcelona since 2008. I studied the double degree in Mathematics and Physics in UAB. I started the master last year and I plan to finish it in June. About my professional experience, I did a Summer Scholarship in DESY, Hamburg, in 2012 and I have also worked in marketing online, creating and managing SEM in Google Adwords. Nowadays I am trying to figure out what I would like to do in the future :)

\section*{Jan Fiser}
I come from the Czech Republic. Last year I finished bachelor's degree in "Mathematical Methods of Information Security" at the Charles University in Prague and this academic year I am studying at UPC with the Erasmus programme.
Although I am interested more in cryptography and abstract algebra, I enrolled here, among others, for courses of discrete algebra or graph theory. I am discovering new areas of mathematics and I enjoy it.

\section*{Arnau Planas}
(github login arnauplanas) I studied a degree in Mathematics and another one in Physical Engineering at UPC (CFIS), 
and I'm coursing this master with the aim to do a PhD. 
I'm specially interested in the area of Differential Geometry and Topology.

\section*{Irene de Parada}

I am from Madrid, where I studied Mathematical Engineering at the Computense University. While doing this I started my bachelor in Physics  at the National University of Distance Education (UNED) and I am currently finishing it. Last year I took some courses at KTH (Stockholm) on statistical methods in Computer Science and Economy. My  bachelor's thesis was about UAV route optimization problem  among obstacles in 2D and 3D. My main areas of interest are Discrete Geometry and Optimization and I would like my future to be related with them.
