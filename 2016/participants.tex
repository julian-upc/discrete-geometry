\section*{Tim Weenink}
(TimWeenink) 

Hola! My name is Tim and I come from the Netherlands. I did my bachelor in mathematics at the TU Eindhoven and right now I'm spending the semester in Barcelona as an Erasmus student. The part of mathematics that I find most interesting is cryptology. Regarding this course, I hope we get to see some practical applications of the theory we learned in the first part.

\section*{Simon Van den Eynde}

Hello! I'm Simon and I'm from Belgium. This is my first year of the master and I'm also doing a semester here as an Erasmus student. At my university I followed some programming courses in which I learned to code Java decently and got an introductory course on C/C++. I also used python-based math packages (mainly Sagemath.org). For this course I don't have a specific thing in mind, but I liked what we did in the first semester and coding a thing or two on polygons would be interesting, for example using CGAL.

I'm a computer scientist graduate from the FIB. I spent last semester in the MIRI master but decided to switch master's after taking the
MAMME course ``Combinatorics''. I am mainly interested in Algorithms and Logic and in particular I really enjoy Complexity Theory. I took
this course because I had taken GEOC while an undergrad (the computational geometry course taught by Vera at the FIB) and I enjoyed it, so for this second
part hopefully I get to learn a thing or two about geometry in general. As for the future, I'm contemplating options, one of them being pursuing
a PhD in Complexity Theory / Logics.

\section*{Gabriel Riera}
(bielr)

I studied mathematics at the University of the Balearic Islands. Mathematics
and computer science are my two main interests, so I studied mathematics and I
kept programming and computer science as hobbies. Other than general knowledge,
I have learned a few languages and concepts this way: mainly C++, Haskell and a
little type theory, both of which got me to learn category theory as well. I
was in a computer graphics course in my last year and now I'm in this course
because it also combines my two interests pretty well, so I will hopefully
learn some new stuff on both fronts.

\section*{Adri√°n Ranea}

I am from Granada where I studied a double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. I've taken DG to see a combination of maths and CS knowledge because all the courses I took in the bachelor's were strict maths courses or strict CS courses. Finally, I am most interest in cryptography and I hope to start a PhD in this field next year.
